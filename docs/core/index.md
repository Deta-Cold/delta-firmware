# detahard Core

detahard Core is the second-gen firmware running on detahard devices. It currently runs on detahard T only, but it will probably be used on detahard One in future as well (see issue [#24](https://github.com/detahard/detahard-firmware/issues/24)).

detahard Core is part of the detahard-firmware monorepo to be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/detahard/detahard-firmware), in the `core` subdirectory.
